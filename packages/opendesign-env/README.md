# @opendesign/env

This package exists to make @opendesign/universal truly universal and to workaround
bugs/missing features in some bundlers. In particular support for `package.json['import']`. See monorepo [readme](https://github.com/opendesigndev/open-design-framework) for more info about OpenDesign in general.
