# Open-Sourcing

We plan to open-source this repo in the future. Before we do that, we'll have to
do the following:

- run yarn install
- remove .pnp*, .vscode and .yarn/sdks from .gitignore so that people do not have
  jump through hoops to setup this repository (other than having corepack)
- update CONTRIBUTING.md
- delete this file
- maybe squash git history? Maybe not, there should not be anything too embarrassing here :-).
